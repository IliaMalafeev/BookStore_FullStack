## Fully functional web application fullstack project

This project is a part of my personal portfolio and is designed to accumulate and demonstrate technical stack that I have learned throughout my coding journey.

It is a fully complete and functional example of online bookstore library and shop. User can browse through various web app pages in order to search for books, checkout books, leave reviews and ratings and so on.

## Brief overview of functionality and purpose

This project consists of **two major parts**, as could be seen in the folder structure.

* **Backend** - REST API server-side application written in Java with usage of Spring Framework and PostgreSQL database.

* **Frontend** - Client side web application written in Typescript with usage of React and various additional tools like Tailwind etc.

Docker containerization system is implemented to allow easy build and test run on any environment if required.
